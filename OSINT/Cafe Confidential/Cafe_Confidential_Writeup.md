## Cafe Confidential: 75 Points

### Challenge Description: Two photos were posted minutes apart by someone of interest. One shows them enjoying a slice of cake in a boutique café; the other captures a well-known landmark in the background. We believe both photos were taken on the same outing. Can you determine exactly which café they visited, and where is it?
Flag format is: C1{Cafe Name_Street Name}
For example, Tom's Cafe located at 31 Mitchell Rd, Boston, MA would be C1{Tom's_Mitchell}.

1. Used TinEye to find clues about the building
2. Used google image reverse search to find info about the cake
3. Found the building location in London and the banners saying "Harrods"
4. Found cake info from an instagram post and its called Parker’s Matilda Cake
5. Checked for Parker's address in London
6. Found flag - C1{Parker’s_Lowndes}
