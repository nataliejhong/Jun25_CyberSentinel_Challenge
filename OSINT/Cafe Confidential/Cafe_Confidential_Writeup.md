## Cafe Confidential: 75 Points

### Challenge Description: Two photos were posted minutes apart by someone of interest. One shows them enjoying a slice of cake in a boutique café; the other captures a well-known landmark in the background. We believe both photos were taken on the same outing. Can you determine exactly which café they visited, and where is it?
Flag format is: C1{Cafe Name_Street Name}
For example, Tom's Cafe located at 31 Mitchell Rd, Boston, MA would be C1{Tom's_Mitchell}.

1. Use google image reverse search to find any information about the 2 images given
