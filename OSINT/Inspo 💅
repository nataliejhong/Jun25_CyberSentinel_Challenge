## Inspo ðŸ’…: 200 Points

### Challenge Description: We believe that the North Torbians are heavily influenced by North Korean developments and wish to match them. We have suspicions that Juche Jaguar will try to build out similar spaces to ones in these pictures. Can you find the coordinates of where these pictures were taken?
The flag is any validÂ decimal degree coordinate notationÂ within a 500m radius of the building.Â The flag is in the following format:Â C1{XX.XXX,XX.XXX}
For example, the White House would be at decimal degree notion of 38.897, -77.036. The flag for the White House would be:Â C1{38.897,-77.036}
Note that this flag is a regex match for any valid coordinate within the 500m radius.
